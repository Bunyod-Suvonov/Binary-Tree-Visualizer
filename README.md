# Binary Tree Visualizer

## Overview

Binary Tree Visualizer is a web application that allows users to visualize binary trees, max-heaps, and binary search trees. It provides an interactive interface to input array values and dynamically generates corresponding visualizations. This project uses D3.js for creating scalable and interactive data visualizations.

## Features

- **Binary Tree Visualization:** Display a binary tree and its corresponding array representation.
- **Max-Heap Visualization:** Visualize a max-heap along with its array representation.
- **Binary Search Tree Visualization:** Create a binary search tree from the given input array.

## Getting Started

1. Visit the [Binary Tree Visualizer](https://bunyod-suvonov.github.io/Binary-Tree-Visualizer/) hosted on GitHub Pages.
2. Enter an array of integers into the "Array" input field.
3. Choose one of the visualization options:
   - **Binary Tree Visualization:** Displays a binary tree and its array representation.
   - **Max-Heap Visualization:** Generates a max-heap along with its array representation.
   - **Binary Search Tree Visualization:** Creates a binary search tree from the input array.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file defining the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the visualizer.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file handling the main logic and interactions.
- `heap.js`: JavaScript file containing functions for heap visualization.
- `nodes.js`: JavaScript file defining the structure and functions for tree nodes.

## Development

To run the project locally, you can clone the repository and open `index.html` in a web browser.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bunyod-suvonov/Binary-Tree-Visualizer.git
  cd Binary-Tree-Visualizer
 ```
